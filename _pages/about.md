Hello, my name is Chenglu Pan (潘成路). My hometown is Nanjing, Jiangsu Province in China and I currently live in Hangzhou. 

I am now a Ph.D candidate from the School of Mathematical Sciences, Zhejiang University in Hangzhou (ZJU). I am advised by [Prof. Qingbiao Wu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0085412). I was also very fortunated to be advised by [Yang Yang](yangy.org) from School of Computer Sciences in Zhejiang University and [Jiarong Xu](galina0217.github.io) from School of Management in Fudan University. Before this, I obtained my undergraduate degree from the School of Mathematical Sciences, Soochow University (SUDA) in Suzhou, majoring in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, guided by [Prof. Shenggao Zhou](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/sgzhou) (now in Shanghai Jiao Tong University).

My research interests include **Graph Neural Networks** and **Federated Learning**.
