Hello, my name is Chenglu Pan (潘成路). My hometown is Nanjing, Jiangsu Province in China and I currently live in Hangzhou. 

I am now a 4th year Ph.D candidate from School of Mathematical Sciences, Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. Qingbiao Wu. I also collaborated closely with [Prof. Yang Yang](https://yangy.org) from School of Computer Sciences, Zhejiang University and [Dr. Jiarong Xu](https://galina0217.github.io) from School of Management, Fudan University. I also collaborate closely with [Dr. Xiaogang Xu](https://xuxiaogang.com/) from Huawei 2012 Lab. Before this, I obtained my bacholar degree from School of Mathematical Sciences, Soochow University, majoring in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, guided by [Prof. Shenggao Zhou](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/sgzhou) (now in Shanghai Jiao Tong University).

My research interests include **Graph Neural Networks**, **Federated Learning** and **generative AI**. Recently, I started my intern at Antgroup, focusing on LLM for repo-level tasks.
